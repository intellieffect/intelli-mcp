## Migration Guide from v1 to v2

### Configuration Files
v1 configuration files are not directly compatible with v2. Use the migration tool:

```bash
npm run migrate:config -- --input v1-config.json --output v2-config.json
```

### API Changes
- All APIs now return `Result<T>` types instead of throwing exceptions
- Server IDs are now strongly typed `UUID` instead of strings
- Configuration objects have been restructured for better type safety

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: Upgraded from 16+ to 18+
- **Operating Systems**: 
  - Windows: 10 version 1903+ (was Windows 8+)
  - macOS: 10.14+ (was 10.12+)
  - Linux: Ubuntu 18.04+ (was Ubuntu 16.04+)

### New Features Not in v1
- Real-time server monitoring
- Health checks and metrics
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Accessibility support
- Dark/light theme switching
- Configuration import/export
- Automatic backups
- Docker deployment
- CI/CD pipeline
